# International-Debt-Analysis-EDA--Project1

#Objective:
perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on international debt data
Store data in SQLite for SQL-based queries
Generate insight such as:
.Number of distinct countries & indicators
.Country with the highest debt
.Average debt per indicator
.most common indicator
.highest principal repayment
Export results to Excel for reporting
Visualize findings with Python plots.

#project conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how to:
- Load and clean large financial datasets.
- Store and query structured data using SQLite.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL + Python.
- Export results into Excel for business/stakeholder reporting.
- Generate insightful visualizations for decision-making.
Findings from queries
1. Number of distinct countries and debt indicators are identified.
2. The country with the highest debt is revealed.
3. We identified which financial indicators carry the most debt on average.
4. The most common debt indicator is highlighted.
5. We also pinpointed the highest principal repayment case.
Business Use Case:
- Governments, economists, and analysts can use this analysis to
track international debt trends, compare debt burdens across countries,
and focus on high-impact debt indicators for policy making.
